### Features

This simple application does two things:
- Kills the PUBG game process
- Relaunches the game (Optional)

### Why?

PUBG is not a stable game... and no one knows when it will be (if ever). Sometimes it freezes on loading screen and if you are lucky, you can kill the game from task manager and restart again from Steam. If you are unlucky (like some users) you can't even kill the process because you are unable to switch to the task manager for some reason and Alt+F4 doesn't work. If you are one of those, or just tired of killing the game manually and relaunching from Steam, this application is for you.

### How it works?

Just run the application, set a custom shortcut if you want (by default it's CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+P) and press Save. If you want to use the relaunch feature, you must browse the Steam.exe. That's all, just click on minimize and it will appear in tray.

### Minimum requirements
It was only tested on Windows 8.1 but you should be able to run on Windows 7, 8 and 10.
